                <h2>Introduction</h2>                               
                    <p>Handball is a very dynamic team sport that amalgamates several other major team 
                        sports such as basketball, soccer, and hockey. A sport widely played in Europe 
                        and perhaps gaining traction with every passing day across the globe, handball
                        boasts dynamic gameplays in which coordination among players is carried out with
                        skill. The following paper endeavors to trace the history of handball, describe
                        an overview of the game, and delineate rules and regulations concerning the sport.
                        </p>
                
                <h2>History of Handball</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ancient Origins</li>                
                            <p>
                            The concept of handball has its historical roots in the
                            ancient civilization where most games have been played in similar forms.
                            The ancient Greeks and Romans had their version of the game where a ball
                            was thrown towards a target, while Mayans and Aztecs played a ball game
                            known as "tlachtli."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In the 19th century,modern handball evolved in Europe. In 1893, the Danish gymnastics 
                            teacher Holger Nielsen developed a field game called "handbold."

                        <li>Emergence of Modern Handball</li>
                
                            <p>
                            Field Handball: In 1906, the German Handball Federation developed the first official
                            rules for handball. This was named field handball because it was played outside; teams                             
                            were larger in size, and the field was shaped like a rectangle.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Indoor Handball: As the game developed, it came to be known as indoor handball. The
                            game of handball debuted at the Olympics in the Berlin Games of 1936, but it was 
                            field handball rather than this version.

                            <p>
                            Standardization of Rules: The International Handball Federation came into existence 
                            in 1946, and in 1954, the first Men's World Championship was held in Sweden. The IHF unified the rules.

                            <p>
                            Women's Handball: The women's version received official recognition in the 1970s, and in 1990, the first
                            Women's World Championship was held in Germany.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Modern Era: Handball continued to grow in popularity, and it now features competitions both in men's
                            and women's events at the international, national, and club levels. Today, handball is a very 
                            popular game in almost all parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

                 <h2>Overview of Handball</h2>                
                    <p>
                    Handball is a team sport that is played by two teams consisting of seven players,
                    one of which is the goalkeeper. The team that scores most against the opponent's goal
                    by throwing the ball into it wins the game. The overall pace of the game is very fast 
                    with rapid transitions included, requiring immense teamwork and tactical planning involved.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>Key Components of the game</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Court</li>
                            <p>
                            The game of handball is played on a rectangular court that is 40 meters long and 20
                            meters wide. At each end of the court, there is a goal. The playing area has lines
                            marked on it, which includes the 6-metre line, known as the goal area, and the 9-metre 
                            line, also known as the free-throw line.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>>The Ball</li>
                            <p>
                            The ball used in handball is the same size as a soccer ball but usually smaller and lighter.
                            For men's teams, the size 3 ball should be used, while for women's teams, size 2 should be used.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Players</li>
                            <p>
                            Each team shall consist of seven players: six outfield players and one goalkeeper. Players can 
                            be substituted at any stage of the game, allowing for seamless changes in strategy.
                            </p>
                    </ol>
                       
                <h2>Rules and Regulations of Handball</h2>                
                    <p>
                    Handball is a game that has its rules, which ensure fair play and the flow of the game.
                    The International Handball Federation oversees these rules and regulations as applied
                    in competitions around the world.
                    </p>

                        <li>Objective</li>
                            <p>
                            The main objective is to score more goals than the opposing
                            team by throwing the ball into the opponent's goal.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            In a regular match, handball is played in two halves, each 30 minutes,
                            with a 10-minute half-time break. If the score happens to be even during
                            knockout competitions, two extra periods of overtime can be played that
                            last for 5 minutes each.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Commencement of Play</li>
                            <p>
                            The game is started with a throw-off, whereby one team throws the ball from
                            the middle of the court to one of its members. It is at this point in time 
                            that the opposing team should not enter within a 3-meter radius of the ball.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Movement with the Ball</li>
                            <p>
                            Players are allowed to take a maximum of three steps while in possession of the ball.
                            A player can dribble the ball, which is to bounce the ball while running, but must pass or shoot within three steps.
                            After picking up the dribble, players must shoot or pass the ball.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Scoring</li>
                            <p>
                            A goal is scored when the whole of the ball has passed the goal line between the goalposts
                            and under the crossbar.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Goalkeeper Rules</li>
                            <p>
                            The goalkeeper may stop the shots with any part of their body. Further,
                            the goalkeeper should be in a position to remain within the goal area, 
                            that is, the 6-meter line. No player is allowed into the goal area except
                            on the occasion of jumping for a shot at it.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Fouls and Free Throws</li>
                            <p>
                            Contact with another player is allowed; however, dangerous or highly aggressive                            
                            actions are considered fouls: for instance, pushing or holding onto another player.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            A foul receives free throws taken from where the foul has occurred. The defending
                            team must remain at least 3 meters away in a free throw.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                A yellow card is issued to a player in cases of light fouls of unsportsmanship conduct while
                                a Red card is a disqualification of a player in cases of serious fouls, repeated offences
                                and violence in court.

                            Teams can make as many substitutions as they like during the match. Substitutes can leave
                            and come onto the court at any time so that teams could work out player fatigue and strategy.
