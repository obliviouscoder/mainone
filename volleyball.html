            <h1>Volleyball: History, Overview, Rules, and Regulations</h1>
            <P>
            Volleyball is one of the most dynamic, exciting team sports with no age or skill level limit. 
            Volleyball is all about teamwork combined with agility and strategic playing; hence, it has 
            grown as a popular game in professional leagues and Olympic events. History of volleyball, an overview 
            about the game of volleyball, main rules, and regulations are discussed in this paper.
            </P>
                
                <h2>History of Volleyball</h2>                
                <P>
                Volleyball was invented in the year 1895 by William G. Morgan, the physical education director 
                at the YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts, USA. The game, initially called "Mintonette," was designed as a 
                mix between basketball, tennis, and handball to be less stressful than basketball for the older members. 
                It followed that the sport developed its own entity quite soon and took its final name from a spectator 
                during an exhibition match, who referred to the volleying nature of the game, thus naming it "volleyball."
                </P>
                
                <p>
                Time passed, and volleyball continued to become more popular; by 1928, the United States Volleyball Association, 
                today known as USA Volleyball, was organized to standardize rules and provide some uniformity to the sport 
                nationwide. In 1947, the **Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) was founded in Paris to oversee 
                the sport on an international level. Volleyball was added to the Olympics in 1964, making its Olympic debut 
                at the Tokyo Games.
                </p>
                
                <P> 
                Beach volleyball is one version of the game that is played on sand by two players of each side, and it 
                was invented in California in the early 1920s. The game turned professional by the 1980s and made 
                its Olympic Games entrance in 1996.
                </P>
                
                <p>
                Today, volleyball is one of the most popular games globally, having huge fanfare, professional leagues, 
                and tournaments being held in every continent.
                </p>
                

                <h2> Overview of Volleyball</h2>                
                <P> 
                Volleyball was played on a rectangular court divided into two sides by a net, and each team had 
                six players. This game had the objective of hitting the ball over the net in a manner that your 
                opponent would not be able to return it legally. A point would be scored in the case where the 
                ball falls on any part of the opponent's court or when the opponent commits a fault.
                </P>
                
                <P> 
                The game is typified by high coordination, teamwork, and agility from the players. They need to 
                move rapidly, jump, and dive to keep the ball going with the intent of overriding the opposing 
                team. It can also be played either indoors or outdoors, popularly called beach volleyball, with 
                different court sizes and number of members in the team. Indoor volleyball usually involves a team 
                of six players, while beach volleyball usually involves two players.
                </P>

                        <P> 
                        These balls are made from leather or artificial leather and inflated to prescribed levels 
                        of pressure. They may weigh between 260-280 grams with a circumference of 65-67 centimeters.

                        <P> 
                        It is the most important volleyball equipment, stretched right across the width of the court. 
                        In the middle, it stands at the standard height for the gender playing, while the sides are 
                        allowed to sag a bit because the netting is stretched taut.

                <h2> Rules and Regulations of Volleyball</h2>                
                <P>
                The rules of volleyball, which are enforced by the FIVB, prescribe how a game is played, scored, 
                and with regard to player conduct. Here's a closer look at the rules that are absolutely fundamental:
                </P>
                    <ul>                
                        <li> Objective of the Game</li>
                        <P> 
                        The object of volleyball is successfully hitting the ball over the net into the opponent's 
                        court and making sure the opponent cannot do the same. Each team has three touches, or hits, 
                        to make this happen and return the ball back to the opponent's court.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Scoring System</li>
                        <P> 
                        Volleyball is a rally scoring sport, meaning a point is scored on every rally, regardless of which 
                        team serves. A match is generally played as the best of five sets, where in each set, the first team 
                        to win 25 points with a minimum advantage of two points is declared the winner, except that in the 
                        fifth set, play is to 15 points. The winner of three sets wins the match.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Service</li>
                        <P>
                        A rally starts with a serve whereby the player hits the ball from behind the back line over the net into 
                        the opponent's court.
                        </P>

                        <P> 
                        It is a rule that the server must remain behind that service line until the ball is struck, and the ball 
                        has to sail over the net into the opponent's service area. If the ball hits the net and goes over, it 
                        can be considered as a valid serve.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Player Positions and Rotations</li>
                        <P> 
                        Teams consist of six players on the court: in two rows of three, the front row, close to the net, and the back row.
                        </P>
                        <P> 
                        After each side-out, players rotate one position clockwise, with a new player moving into the serving position.
                        The players in the front row are usually attackers or blockers, and those in the back row can be defenders and setters.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> To Handle the Ball</li>
                        <P> 
                        Teams have three hits to return the ball to the opposite side. A hit is a bump (forearm pass), a set, spike, or block.
                        It prohibits catching, holding, or throwing of the ball, allowing only one player at a time in contact with the ball, 
                        except during blocking.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Contact and Ball Movement</li>
                        <P> 
                        Avoid any double contacts, hitting the ball twice in succession, and ensure the ball never comes to 
                        rest while it is being hit.The ball may be hit by any part of the body provided the contact is clean 
                        and the ball does not rest.
                        </P>
                    </ul>

                        <li> Net Touching</li>
                        <P> 
                        No player shall touch the net during play. If a player touches the net while trying to play 
                        the ball, the opposing team gets the point.
                        </P>

                        Players are not allowed to step over the centerline beneath the net. This is a fault and 
                        a point for the opponent.
                        </P>

                        <P>
                        A back-row player is not allowed to attack the ball in the front court except when jumping 
                        from behind the attack line, also called the three-meter line.
                        </P>

                        <P> 
                        Blockers cannot reach over the net and interfere with the opponent's set or attack unless 
                        it involves a blocking action, and contact comes after the opponent has made contact with 
                        the ball.

                        Teams rotate every time they win the right to serve, according to a predetermined rotation order. 
                        If teams fail to rotate properly, this is a rotation fault and results in a point for the opponent.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Four Hits</li>

                        A team is allowed to touch the ball only three times before sending it over to the opponent's side. 
                        If a team hits the ball four times, then it becomes a fault.

                            This is an overhead pass of the ball to position it for a spike. Generally done by 
                            the setter, who attempts to place the ball near the net.

                <h2> Player Roles and Positions</h2>                
                <P>
                Each of the players has a specialized role; they can either be an offense player or a defense 
                player. Some of the common roles are as follows:
                </P>
                    <ul>                
                        <li> Setter</li>
                        <P> 
                        The player in this position is supposed to set the ball for the attackers. He is usually 
                        thought of as the "quarterback" of the team and is often called upon to decide who should attack.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Outside Hitter</li>
                        <P> 
                        Usually positioned on the left side of the front row, this player is the main attacker. They are often 
                        targeted as a receiver of the ball and are expected to play both offensively and defensively.
                        </P>
                                    
                        <li> Opposite Hitter or Right-Side Hitter</li>
                        <P> 
                        This is the player who stands on the right side. He is usually the second most important attack 
                        of the team, but he takes on more responsibility in blocking with the opponent's outside hitter.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Middle Blocker/Hitter:</li> 
                        <P> 
                        The middle blocker stands in the center position. This player's main job is blocking the opponents' 
                        shots with fast attacks near the net.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Libero</li>
                        <P> 
                        A specialized defensive player who is forbidden from attacking the ball above the net height. 
                        They wear a differently coloured jersey from that of the other team players; they are supposed 
                        to be digging and passing.
                        </P>
                
                        <li> Defensive Specialist</li> 
                        <P> 
                        A little like the Libero, but without many restrictions. The Defensive Specialists specialize 
                        in Defence and are often substituted for front-row players when necessary.
                        </P>
                    </ul>
                
    
                <h2> Conclusion</h2>
                <P>
