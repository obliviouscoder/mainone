            <h1>Golf - a Brief Overview: History, Rules</h1>
                <p>
                Golf is one of those sports that has dominated the interests and passions of many
                worldwide for several centuries. The great respect, challenge, and skill it procures
                have blended to make it an endeavor of both precision and patience. It has a rather 
                interesting history and a somewhat structured set of rules to boot. We will 
                give an overview of where golf came from, how golf is played, and the respective rules
                and regulations within this rich sport.
                </p>
            
                
                <h2>History of Golf</h2>
                    <p>                
                    Though much debate exists over where the game of golf was invented, the general 
                    view is that the game, as considered in modern times, came from Scotland in the 15th 
                    century. However, several stick-and-ball games have existed in many parts of the world 
                    since ancient times, including Dutch "kolf" and French "chole," among others.
                    </p>

                    <p>                
                    The first written records of the game appear in 1457, a ban enacted by the Scottish 
                    Parliament, which condemned golf, along with football, as a distraction from military
                    training. By the early 16th century the ban was lifted and golf was gaining in popularity. 
                    Mary, Queen of Scots was an avid golfer and served to further popularize the game within
                    the Scottish aristocracy.
                    </p>

                    <p>                
                    The Old Course in St. Andrews in Scotland was therefore termed as "The Home of Golf" 
                    and has taken up innumerable prestigious tournaments. St. Andrews also formulated most 
                    of the early traditions and rules of the sport. In 1744, the first official set of rules
                    was developed by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, while the 18-hole standard
                    for a round of golf was established at St. Andrews in 1764.
                    </p>

                    <p>                
                    It, therefore, gained its spreading momentum in the late 19th century with the establishment
                    of golf clubs in the United States, Canada, and other parts of Europe. In 1894, the United 
                    States Golf Association was established with the R&A as the governing body for golf in countries
                    and states outside of North America. The Professional Golfers' Association of America instituted 
                    in 1916 and since then, it has been among the most popular and widely played sports in the world.

                <h2>Overview of Golf</h2>               
                    <p>
                    Golf is a game played individually by stroking a small, dimpled ball into a series of holes
                    on a course in the fewest possible number of strokes. Every course is composed of 18 holes,
                    though some courses have only nine for shorter rounds of golf. Each hole is uniquely cut
                    into the course with a variety of hazards, including bunkers, water hazards, trees, and
                    rough grassy terrain, that makes the game of golf one of strategic shot selection, just as
                    much as physical skill.
                    </p>

                    <p>                
                    The aim of golf is simple: to complete the round with as few strokes as possible. A standard
                    golf course consists of **par-3, par-4, and par-5 holes**, where "par" refers to the amount 
                    of strokes a first-class golfer should need to finish the hole. A normal stroke to complete 
                    the round involves 72 for 18 holes, but scores differ greatly among players of various classes.
                    </p>
                
            
                <h2>Golf Equipment</h2>
                <p>These include:</p>
                    <ol>
                                        
                        <li>Golf Clubs</li>
                        <p> 
                        A player is allowed to carry a maximum of 14 golf clubs in his golf bag,
                        which includes drivers, woods, irons, wedges, and one putter. Each one has
                        a different purpose and is used according to either the distance or according 
                        to the type of stroke.
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                        It is dimpled on the surface to reduce further the amount of air resistance it
                        would encounter for even more flight control. The size and weight of the ball
                        must be according to the regulations laid down by USGA and R&A.
                        </p>
                
                        <li>Other Equipment</li>
                        <P>The other important accessories in golf are tees, golf gloves, markers, and golf bags.</P>
                    </ol>
           
                <h2>Rules and Regulations of Golf</h2>
                    <p>                
                    They vary from how a round is started to how one properly acts on the course. 
                    So far as regulations go, golf is essentially controlled by two main governing bodies:
                    The United States Golf Association (USGA) and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews
                    (R&A), jointly publishing the official Rules of Golf.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>Basic Rules of Play</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Teeing Off</li>
                            <p>
                            Each hole is started from the teeing area and involves placing the ball on a tee for the first stroke.
                            A player must play the ball from behind the tee-markers, and he may tee his ball lower than the height
                            of the tee.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            After the initial tee shot, players try to move the ball further down the fairway or the main playing 
                            area toward the green. The roughs off the sides of the fairways are composed of longer grasses or other 
                            hazards that make the advancement of the ball more difficult.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Reaching the Green</li>                
                                <p>
                                The objective of the game is to have the ball come to rest on the putting surface, called the 
                                green-a nicely manicured grassy area that surrounds the hole. Players, using a putter on 
                                green, roll the ball into the hole.
                                </p>

                                    This is the most common format, whereby every stroke is counted, with the play
                                    having the lowest count over 18 holes winning.
                                    </p>

                                    Points are awarded based on the number of strokes taken in relation to par, rather

                    <li>>Pace of Play</li>
                        <p>
                        Golf is a gentlemen/ladies game, and hence good pace is expected for the same.
                        Players are encouraged to be ready at every shot so that it may not delay the game.
                        </p>
                
                    <li>Order of Play</li>
                        <p>
                        The generally accepted rule is that the person farthest from the hole plays first, 
                        although other formats, like "ready golf," allow the first ready player to hit.
                        </p>
                
                    <li>>Honesty and Integrity</li>
                        <p>
                        Golf has been termed a "gentleman's game" because honor plays a big role in the game. 
                        Players are supposed to keep their own score and declare penalties even when nobody else notices.
                        </p>
                
                    <li>Care for the Course</li>
                        <p>
                        Players should repair divots on the fairway, rake bunkers, and do nothing to cause
                        unnecessary damage to the course.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        When a ball happens to go out of bounds, a player takes one penalty stroke and
                        replays from where he had played.

                        If the ball lands in any unplayable area, then a player can take a penalty
                        stroke by dropping the ball within two club lengths from the original spot 
                        but not nearer the hole.

                        If within three minutes, any player cannot find his ball, the ball is considered lost,
                        and he has to play another ball from the last position with a one-stroke penalty.

                    <li>Relief from Obstructions</li>
                        <p>
                        Where the ball lands and there is an immovable obstruction, relief may be taken by 
                        dropping within one club-length radius of the nearest point of relief without penalty.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                    Golf traditionally has been a game steeped in its core in tradition and history, with its rules 
                    taking several centuries to develop. Modern golf is noted for its mainly accurate, patient, and
                    sporting gameplay, with an attached rather complex system of rules and regulations designed to
                    keep everything fair on the course. Whether taken as a casual pastime or a professional sport,
                    golf has continued to hypnotize its participants and audiences alike by offering unique
                    challenges and rewards from other games.
