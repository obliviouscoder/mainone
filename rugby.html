            <h1>Rugby: History, Overview, and Rules</h1>
                <p>
                Rugby is a very exciting, quick contact sport that includes strength, endurance, and aspects of
                strategic gameplay. It has a rich history and comes mainly in two forms of play: Rugby Union and
                Rugby League. Each of these has its own rules and following around the world. This article covers 
                the origins of rugby, an overview of the sport, and then an in-depth look into what the rules and 
                regulations are in rugby.
                </p>
            
                <h2> Brief History of Rugby</h2>
                    <p> 
                    It is of 19th-century English origin. Rugby is said to have been invented in 1823, when
                    William Webb Ellis, a student at the Rugby School, supposedly picked up the soccer ball 
                    during a game and began running with it. Though the above story is never verified, the sport
                    spread into Rugby School and hence the name. Rugby gained popularity in England and the rest
                    of the United Kingdom in the middle of the 19th century. The Rugby Football Union was
                    established in 1871 to formulate standardized rules and to administer some competitions
                    in England. Then, Scotland and England played the first international rugby match.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Eventually, disagreement over rules and remuneration of players eventually led, in 1895,
                    to the appearance of two specific forms of rugby: Rugby Union and Rugby League. Rugby
                    Union-essentially a game of amateurs-stayed closer to the older version of rugby, 
                    while Rugby League introduced changes to make their variant of the game faster and
                    even more spectacular.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Rugby Union really got going in 1987 with the inaugural Rugby World Cup, and in 1995
                    Rugby Union became a professional game. Rugby League has also spread to most of the
                    other countries and has its own World Cup, competed on a regular basis since 1954.
                    Rugby has an enormous worldwide following; it is most popular in countries like New
                    Zealand, England, Australia, South Africa, and France.
                    </p>

                <h2> Overview of Rugby</h2> 
                    <p> 
                    Rugby is a full-contact sport wherein two competing teams try to carry, pass, and kick an oval-shaped ball
                    into their opponent's in-goal area or across the goalposts for points. Rugby Union and Rugby League are
                    pretty much similar in most aspects of the game, although the number of players differs together
                    with ways of scoring and some rules.
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Rugby Union</li>
                            <p>
                            Played with 15 players per team, including eight forwards and seven backs.
                            Rugby Union emphasizes strategic play and contests for possession in scrums, line-outs, and rucks.
                            </p>
                            <li> Rugby League</li>
                            <p>
                            This version involves 13 players in each team, placing strong emphasis on
                            continuous play, fewer scrums, and fewer rules. League matches are generally quicker than Union matches.
                            </p>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                    Both versions are also done on a rectangular field with a goalpost at each end. In Rugby Union,
                    a standard match lasts for 80 minutes, divided into two halves, while Rugby League matches also last 80 minutes.
                    </p>

                        <li> Forwards (1-8)</li>
                        <p>
                        Forwards are known for their physical strength that would help them in scrums
                        and line-outs. They win the possession.They include:

                <h2> Laws and Regulations of Rugby Union</h2>
                    <h3>Basic Game Rules</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Purpose of the Game</li>
                        <p> 
                        The main goal involves scoring points against the other team, which must be 
                        higher than the opponent's by the end of the game, through means such as a try, 
                        conversion, penalty goal, and drop goal.
                        </p>

                        <li> Play Resumption</li>
                        <p> 
                        It starts with the kickoff from the center of the halfway line when the first 
                        team kicks the ball in the opponent's field. Opponents are, therefore, free to
                        take over carrying the ball up to towards the opponent's goal line.
                        </p>

                        <li> Grading</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Try</li> 
                                <p> 
                                5 points, awarded when a player has grounded the ball in the opponent's in-goal area.
                                </p>
                                
                                <li> Conversion</li>
                                <p>  
                                Once a try is scored, there is the chance to kick a conversion for an extra 2 points.
                                </p>
                                
                                <li> Penalty Goal</li>  
                                <p> 
                                Carries 3 points; it involves kicking the ball between or through the opponent's 
                                goalpost during a penalty.
                                </p>
                                <li> Drop Goal</li> 
                                <p>
                                A goal is considered 3 points when a player, during play, drops the ball to 
                                the ground and then kicks it through the posts.
                                </p>
                            </ul>

                        <li> Moving the Ball</li>
                        <p> 
                        Players are allowed only to run with the ball, pass laterally 
                        or backward, but kicking forward. Players can only pass the ball 
                        forward when kicking it.
                        </p>

                        <li> Tackling and Rucks</li>
                        <p> 
                        For a tackle, a player in possession is taken to the ground. The player has to 
                        release the ball, and play continues through a ruck or maul.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                        For a ruck, the players of both teams are on their feet, the ball is on the ground, 
                        and players try to push against one another for the ball.
                        </p>

                        <li> Scrum</li>
                        <p>
                        A scrum is a set piece involving players from both teams where eight players from each 
                        team interlock heads and push forward to compete for the ball against the other team. 
                        Scrums are used for restarting the game after minor infringements.
                        </p>

                        <li> Line-Out</li>
                        <p> 
                        The recommended form of play in case the ball has gone into touch is by line-out; 
                        forwards on either side, lining up, with one of the teams throwing the play back in 
                        between them, where the two jump and compete.
                        </p>
                    </ol>

                <h2>Penalties and Fouls</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Offside</li>
                        <p> 
                        Players must be behind the ball, or they are considered offside. This diminishes 
                        the involvement of a player in the play, and one will be penalized for being offside.
                        </p>

                        <li> High Tackles</li>
                        <p> 
                        High tackles are those where a player tackles his opponent above his shoulders; this 
                        is dangerous play and hence attracts a penalty. These, if repeated or serious, merit 
                        yellow cards for temporary exclusion or red cards for exclusion throughout the game.
                        </p>

                        <li> Forward Pass</li>
                        <p>
                        It is forbidden to pass the ball forward; the scrum is played to 
                        the opponent following this action.
                        </p>

                        <li> Knock-On</li>  

                        <p> 
                        If a player accidentally knocks the ball forward with his hand or arm, it is 
                        considered a knock-on play and the other team gets a scrum.
                        </p>

                        <li> Penalties and Free Kicks</li>
                        <p> 
                        Of the many infringements, some are punished by allowing the other team to kick 
                        for goal, kick to touch, or take a scrum.
                        </p>

                <h2> Rugby League Rules and Some Key Differences from Rugby Union</h2>
                <p> 
                While Rugby League shares many fundamentals with Rugby Union, notable differences exist:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Team size; player's role:</li>
                    <p> 
                    League 13 players to a side, as opposed to 15, made up of a similar composition of forwards and backs.
                    </p>


                    <li>  Scoring:</li>
                    <p> 
                    League-try is 4 points as compared to 5 in Union. There's a conversion of 2 points, 
                    a penalty goal of 2 points and a drop goal of 1 point.
                    </p>

                    <li> Tackling and Play-the-Ball:</li>
                    <p>
                    League has the tackled player get to his feet and play the ball back with his foot 
                    to a teammate. There is no contest for possession in a ruck as there is in Union.
                    </p>

                    <li> Group of Six:</li>
                    <p> 
                    League teams may make only six successive tackles to gain territory, at which point the
                    team must score or kick the ball-in other words, failure to do so gives possession away.
                    </p>

                    <li> Scrums and Line-Outs</li> 
                    <p> 
                    The scrums in League are uncontested and, hence, primarily a means of restarting
                    the game, while line-outs do not exist under Rugby League.
                    </p>
                </ol> 

            <h2> Conclusion</h2>
                <p> 
                Rugby is a powerful, skillful, and tactical sport that is full of history and passionately followed across
                the world. Be it Rugby Union or Rugby League, the rules of the games provide a dynamic environment that
                emphasizes physical endurance as much as tactical play. The subtle differences within each code are what
                bring the fans and professionals back for more, making rugby one of the most treasured sports globally.
