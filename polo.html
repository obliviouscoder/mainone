            <h1>Polo: History, Overview, and Rules</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>   
                <p> 
                Polo is an ancient, highly polished team sport that was founded over 2,000 years ago in 
                ancient Persia. Because it requires highly developed athletic skills and horsemanship in
                almost equal measure, it has acquired the nickname "the sport of kings." Players on horseback 
                try to score goals by hitting a ball with a long-handled mallet into the opponent's goal.
                Polo has grown to be one of the most favored sports in almost all parts of the world. The 
                origin of this article goes back to tracing where polo is, goes over what polo is, and describes 
                rules and regulations, making it one of the most interesting and thrilling sports in the world.
                </p>
                
        
                <h2>History of Polo</h2>                
                    <p> 
                    Its origins are more than 2,500 years old, as it originated in Persia-now Iran-as a training
                    game for cavalry units sometime in the 6th century BC. The game was called "chogan" in Persian
                    and was used to train the soldiers in order to improve their horsemanship; the game was one way 
                    through which their military tactics could be devised. By this time, it spread over the entire 
                    and was popular amongst Indian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern royalties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It originated in the Indian subcontinent during the 13th century and rapidly gained popularity
                    amongst the aristocracy and British troops stationed there. It was formalized during the 19th 
                    century by British colonial officers who exported it to England and turned it into a widely
                    known sport in no time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The first official polo club, the Calcutta Polo Club, was founded in 1862, and it wasn't long
                    before England saw its first clubs and tournaments. The United States followed with the United
                    States Polo Association (USPA) in 1890 and still today, the governing body for the sport in the
                    U.S. Today, the game is both professionally and recreationally played throughout much of the 
                    world, mainly in countries such as Argentina, the U.S., the U.K., and Australia.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>Overview of Polo</h2>                
                    <p> 
                    Polo is one of the few team sports played quite rapidly on horseback. It deals with a 
                    team of four players attempting to hit a small-sized ball into the opponent team's goal. 
                    The sport is usually played on a huge open field measuring 300 yards by 160 yards, nearly 
                    the size of nine football fields.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Of course, polo also requires speed, coordination, and skill since the horses have to be
                    maneuvered with one hand while the player wields a long mallet with the other. There has
                    to be a mixture of strategy and precision in the field in the way fast plays are made or
                    in the hopes of outplaying the opponent.
                    </p>
                
                <h2> Polo Equipment</h2>
                <ol>                
                    <li> Polo Pony</li>
                    <p>  
                    Despite the name, these horses are full-sized, often thoroughbreds or Argentine breeds, known for agility
                    and speed. Each player needs several horses, as each "chukka" or period uses fresh horses.
                    </p>

                    <li> Mallet</li>
                    <p> 
                    The mallet has a long handle of bamboo or composite with a hardwood head. The players hi
                    the ball with the mallet downfield or toward the goal.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Helmet</li>
                    <p> 
                    Considering how dangerous the game is, polo players wear helmets-out of which many
                    have face guards or visors for protection against falls or hits by the mallet or the ball.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Ball</li>
                    <p> 
                    The ball is usually of hard plastic and normally 3 to 3.5 inches in diameter for field polo. 
                    For arena polo, it would be slightly larger and softer.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Other Equipment</li> 
                    <p> 
                    These include knee guards, gloves, and at times face guards to further protect the player.
                    Riding boots and breeches bring comfort and safety when riding a horse.
                    </p>
                </ol>
                 
                <h2> Rules and Regulations of Polo</h2>                
                    <p> 
                    Polo has rules instituted by governing organizations such as the Hurlingham Polo Association (HPA)
                    in the U.K. and the USPA in the U.S. that ensure fair play, safety for the players, and sportsmanship.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Basic Rules of Play</h3>
                    <ol>                
                        <li>Objective of the Game</li>
                        <p> 
                        To win a game in polo, a team has to score more goals than its opponent. 
                        A goal is said to be scored when a player successfully hits the ball between 
                        the opponent's goalposts.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Teams and Position</li>
                        <p>
                        A team is constituted with four players, each number denoting a different position ranging from 1 to 4.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Player 1: This usually includes the major offensive player who scores most of the points.</li>
                            <li> Player 2: May be an all-round player, majored in both offense and defense; sometimes used as a backup for Player 1.</li>
                            <li> Player 3: He usually is the captain of the team; they are used in implementing
                                 strategies during play to ensure that the pace of the game is controlled.
                            </li>
                            <li> Player 4: This player stays a defensive player who mainly covers his team's goal area.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <li> Periods of Play (Chukkas)</li>
                        <p> 
                        A typical outdoor match is played for 4 to 8 chukkas, each played for 7 minutes. Within this time
                        players change horses so their horses are always fresh.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        At the end of each chukka, the clock stops and only restarts after a short break.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Scoring and Direction of Play</li>
                        <p> 
                        Teams alternate goal direction with each scored goal so that neither team shall have an advantage 
                        over the other due to wind direction or field conditions.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Start of Game</li>
                        <p> 
                        The game starts with what is called a "throw-in," where the umpire throws the ball between 
                        the two teams lined up opposite each other.
                        </p>
                    </ol>
                
                <h3>Rules of Movement and Play</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Right of Way and Line of the Ball</li>
                        <p> 
                        Polo emphasizes players' safety wherein at every impact of the ball, an imaginary "line of 
                        the ball" should be drawn in the direction where the ball moved. Players having the line 
                        of the ball are entitled with right of way and opponents have to avoid at all costs
                        crossing this line to prevent collision.
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                        The right-of-way rule prevents hazardous moves because players continue to move
                        in one direction with less-sharp changes of movement.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Hooking</li>
                        <p> 
                        One player may interfere with another player's swing by "hooking" the opponent's mallet with his own.
                        This hooking can be done only when both players are on one side of the ball, to prevent a hazardous reach across.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Riding Off</li>
                        <p>
                        Players may take their horses and "ride off" another player's horse to clear that opponent out
                        and away from the ball. Riding off must be shoulder-to-shoulder and at a safe angle so as not
                        to harm horse or player.
                        </p>
                    </ol>
                
                <h3> Fouls and Penalties</h3>              
                    <ol>
                        <li> Crossing the Line</li>
                        <p> 
                        A foul is considered when the line of a ball is crossed by a player and the right of
                        way for another player is interfered with.
                        </p>

                        <li> Hook Incorrectly</li>
                        <p>
                        If the hooking player is at an angle to the opposing player or crosses over the opposing
                        player's horse, then that will be considered a foul.
                        </p>

                        <li> Dangerous Riding</li>
                        <p> 
                        A penalty is awarded to avoid injury to horses and players: dangerous riding,
                        for example, bumping at an unsafe angle.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Types of Penalty Shots</li>
                        <p> 
                        Depending on the severity of the foul, penalty shots are awarded at the following distances from the goal:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Penalty 1: This is an automatic goal given for serious fouls near the goal.</li>
                            <li> Penalty 2: Free shot from 30 yards out, all other players distance away.</li>
