                <h2>Introduction</h2>                
                    <p>
                    Muay Thai is a Thai combat sport that follows the use of punches, kicks, elbows, 
                    and knee strikes. The sport has also been variously known as the "Art of Eight Limbs,"
                    that was famous for hard techniques and strenuous training methods. Muay Thai has 
                    gained worldwide recognition in competitive sports and self-defense. The article
                    goes into the history of Muay Thai, from a general description of its techniques
                    and mode of training, to its rules and regulations.

                        <p>
                        Muay Thai traces its roots back to ancient Thai warriors in the 13th century, 
                        during their military training. As a combat art, its development was mainly intended
                        for hand-to-hand combat in the field of battle. In fact, the martial arts developed
                        from the traditional fighting arts of neighboring countries bordering it, such as                           
                        China and India.

                        <p>
                        Muay Thai gained more structure and organization as a martial art during the reign of
                        King Naresuan during the Chakri Dynasty, 1584 to 1605. It was used to train soldiers and was also practiced during
                        peacetime as a means of physical fitness and discipline.

                <h2>Basic Elements</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Striking Techniques</li>
                            <p>The major techniques in Muay Thai include the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Punches (Chok):</li> <p> Various types of punches are performed, including jabs, crosses, and hooks.</p>
                                <li>Kicks (Te):</li><p>  A major form of kicking is done in the form of roundhouse kicks with the shin.</p>
                                <li>Elbow Strikes (Sok):</li><p>  These strikes come within a very close distance; the strike can occur 
                                    from practically any angle.</p>
                                <li>Knee Strikes (Kao):</li>
                                <p>  Knee strikes would be more effective during fights within a close range.</p>
                                </ul>
                
                        <li>Stances</li>
                            <p> Boxers assume special stances adapted for ease of movement with striking advantage provided by:</p>
                                <ul>

                            <p>
                            Muay Thai's defense consists of blocking, evasion, and clinching. A clinch7
                            is a position where the two fighters grapple with each other in close quarters,
                            generally to control the posture of an opponent and set up strikes.
                            </p>

                                traditional garb, including the headband known as a **mongkhon** and **prajioud**
                                armbands when competing. The Wai Khru pre-fight dance is a ritual of respect and

                                The following techniques are considered illegal in competition
                                Muay Thai: Groin kicks, elbows to the back of the head/neck,
                                takedowns/throws not authorized by the rules, and striking a 
                                fallen opponent or one out of the ring.

                                disqualification.
