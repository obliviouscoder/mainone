            <h1>Tennis: History, Overview, Rules, and Regulations</h1>
            <p> 
            Throughout the world, tennis is considered one of the most popular and enduring sports, 
            combining athleticism with finesse and strategy in an explosion of speed, breathtaking 
            rallies, and formidable competitors. Having a history spanning several centuries, this 
            article shall attempt to look into the history of tennis, an overview of the game itself, 
            and the basic rules and regulations that shape it.
            </p>              
        
                <h2> History of Tennis</h2>                
                <p> 
                Tennis is a derivative of an ancient medieval game called "jeu de paume," or game 
                of the palm, that was invented in France during the 12th century. Originally played 
                by hitting the ball with the palm of the hand, the players eventually began using 
                gloves for this purpose and still later, paddles. With the introduction of rackets 
                in the 16th century, the name would be coined as "tennis."
                </p>

                <p>                
                Tennis, as we know it today and very often call "lawn tennis," was invented in England 
                in 1873, when Major Walter Clopton Wingfield patented a game under the name of "Sphairistikè"-
                that is, Greek for "playing ball." The sport was played on a grass court and included a bunch 
                of rules that are functioning nowadays in tennis. First the name tennis evolved with time, and 
                so did the sport in both popularity and structure as its first tennis clubs began to form first 
                in Britain, then in the United States.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                The first Wimbledon Championship took place in 1877, where the game of tennis became organized 
                as a competitive sport. Wimbledon is the oldest and currently one of the most widely recognized 
                tennis tournaments globally. In 1913, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF)-now 
                known by the name International Tennis Federation (ITF)-was established and up to this day 
                remains in charge of international tennis.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                These days, tennis is played globally, with four major events, also referred to as Grand Slams—Wimbledon, 
                the French Open, the U.S. Open, and the Australian Open—which are considered the highlights of the game.
                </p>                

                <h2> Summary of Tennis</h2>                
                <p> 
                Tennis is also played in either of two formats: singles. The object of the game is to hit the ball over 
                the net into the opponent's court in such a way that the opponent cannot return it and earn points.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                The game can be played on a rectangular court divided by a net; each surface imparts different 
                characteristics to the game: grass, clay, and hard. Generally speaking, points are gained consecutively, 
                where players fight for winning of the set. The first player who wins six games with at least two games 
                difference is the winner of the set, and the first who wins the majority of sets is the winner of the match.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Tennis is one of those games that requires a perfect blend of all aspects: physical fitness, mental agility, 
                and technical skill. The game of tennis calls for quick speeds, hand-eye coordination, and nimble footwork, 
                along with the strategic ability of players to adjust to the opponent's tactics. 
                </p>
                

                <h2> Tennis Equipment</h2>
                <ol>                
                    <li> Racket</li>
                    <p> 
                    Tennis racquets come in an assortment of sizes, weights, and string tensions. Players choose 
                    racquets based on style of play, level of ability, and personal preference, made from graphite, 
                    aluminum, or composite materials.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Ball</li> 
                    <p> 
                    A tennis ball has a rubber core, felt covering, and air inside that provides its bouncy effect. 
                    They are colored yellow or bright green to make them more visible for the players.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Court</li> 
                    <p> 
                    The length and width of a tennis court are 78 feet and 27 feet, respectively, for a single match. 
                    However, in a double match, one can play with 9 feet on each side. The center of the net at the top must be 3 feet.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Other Equipment</li>
                    <p>
                    Players also use special tennis shoes that are designed to support and provide traction on various court surfaces, 
                    and wear protective clothing for comfort during play.
                    </p>
                </ol>
                
                 
                <h2> Rules and Regulations of Tennis</h2>                
                <p> 
                The ITF regulates the rules of tennis. These rules range from scoring to the actual acts of 
                playing to code of conduct. Here's a detailed look into the key rules:
                </p>

                <p>The basic rules of play for tennis include:</p>
                <ol>            
                    <li> Objective of the Game</li>
                    <p>
                    In tennis, the aim of the game is to win points by hitting the ball into the opponent's court 
                    in such a way that it lands within the boundaries and the opponent should not be able to return 
                    it successfully.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Scoring System</li>
                    <p> 
                    Tennis has one of the strangest scoring systems; points go from 15, 30, 40, and "game." 
                    To win a game, one needs to have at least four points with a difference of two points 
                    between himself and his opponent.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                    If both players reach 40 points, this is a "deuce," thus meaning a player has to win two 
                    successive points to take the game.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                    A match is divided into sets, and the first player to win six games by at least two games 
                    wins the set. Most matches are best of three sets, with men's Grand Slam matches best of five sets.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Serving</li>
                    <p> 
                    The server shall change sides after every point, serving first from the right side of the baseline 
                    diagonally across the net into the opponent's service box. Thus, the server has two chances to serve 
                    in a valid manner. If a serve goes out of the service box, then the serve is said to be "faulted" and 
                    if both attempts happen to fail, it is counted as "double fault" and a point for the opponent.
                    </p>
                
                    <p> 
                    A "let" occurs when the serve hits the net but still drops into the proper service box; then it is replayed.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Change of Sides</li>
                    <p> 
                    The players switch sides of the court at the end of every unevenly numbered game in a set, 
                    so that the players can play in equal conditions concerning sun, wind, and wear on the court.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Winning a Point</li>
                    <p> 
                    There are various ways of winning a point, for example: when the ball has bobbled 
                    twice on the opponent's ground; when it falls outside the court or when the opponent 
                    hits into the net or misses the return.
                    </p>
                    <ul>                
                        <li> Backhand</li>
                        <p> 
                        Hit from the nondominant side, either one-handed or two-handed, to return balls 
                        to players on the off-side of a ground stroke.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Serve</li>
                        <p> 
                        A shot that starts every point. An aggressive serve with proper placement is 
                        an important positive attribute because players want to hit aces.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> olley</li> 
                        <p> 
                        Struck before the ball has had time to bounce, generally out of the air near the 
                        net, placing pressure on the opponent.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Overhead Smash</li>
                        <p>  
                        A powerful shot played over the head, often to a lob.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Drop Shot</li> 
                        <p>
                        A soft shot, just over the net, placed to fall as near as possible 
                        to the opponent's side to make them hurry forward.
                        </p>
                
                        <li> Lob</li> 
                        <p> 
                        A high, curving shot that sends the ball over the opponent to retreat them, 
                        generally when the opponent is positioned at the net.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                
                <li>Faults and Violations</li>
                <ul>                
                    <li> Foot Fault</li>
                    <p> 
                    The server has to remain behind the baseline till the ball is hit; failing that, 
                    it would be considered a foot fault.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Ball In or Out</li>
                    <p> 
                    A ball falling out of the limits is considered "out," and the point goes to the opponent. 
                    In professional games, line judges and electronic tools like "Hawk-Eye" sometimes help decide 
                    the close calls of whether a ball is in or out.
                    </p>
                
                    <li> Double Hit and Carrying</li>
                    <p> 
                    It is a fault if the player hits the ball twice or carries it on the racket in 
                    the return-he can hit the ball only once.
                    </p>

                    <li> Touching the Net</li>
                    <p> 
                    During the rally, the player must not touch the net with his body, racket, 
                    or anything worn. This gives the opponent a point.
                    </p>
                </ul>
