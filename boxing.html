            <h1>Boxing: History, Overview, and Rules</h1>
             <h2>History of Boxing</h2>
            <p>
                Boxing is one of the oldest combat sports there has ever been, with its roots tracing 
                way back to ancient civilizations. The history can be broadly categorized into several key periods:
            </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Ancient Origins</li>
                     <p>
                        Mesopotamia and Egypt: Boxing activities seem to have been in evidence from ancient
                        Mesopotamian carvings dating back as far as 3000 BCE. Wall paintings depict ancient 
                        Egyptian boxers showing modern-like boxing methods:
                    </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Greece</li>
                            <p>
                            Boxing was famous in ancient Greek Olympics and was called "pygmachia."
                            It was the Greeks who originally established rules and also established a 
                            certain style of boxing. They wore leather straps around their hands for protection.
                            </p>

                            <Li>Rome</Li>
                            <p>
                            Boxing then became a favorite spectator sport among the Romans. However, 
                            it was brutal because there were more few restrictions on how boxers could 
                            attack. Gladiators often boxed each other. Injures were common.
                            </p>
                        </ol>
                    <li>The Middle Ages to the 18th Century</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Decline and Revival</li>
                            <p>
                            Immediately following the Roman Empire's fall,
                            boxing declined in Europe. Later in the 17th century, however, boxing 
                            began to appear once more as an upper-class sport.
                            </p>

                            <li>Bare-knuckle Boxing</li>
                            <p>
                            By the 18th century, bare-knuckle boxing became 
                            the dominant form of in-ring combat often in makeshift rings. Slight and 
                            unwritten rules existed among the fighting boxers, also known as "pugilists,"
                            and the contests were undoubtedly brutal and unorganized.
                            </p>
                        </ol>

                                <p>
                                The big turning point in boxing came through the
                                Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which laid down certain formal regulations: the wearing of gloves,
                                three-minute rounds, and a ten-second count for knockouts.
                                </p>
                 
                            <li>Professionalization</li>
                                <p>
                                The establishment of professional boxing organizations during the late 
                                19th century placed the sport on the world calendar, with the United States and the UK right at the forefront.
                                </p>
                        </ol>

                <h2> Overview of Boxing</h2>
                <p>
                 Boxing is regarded as a combative sport in which the two opponents, with their gloves on,
                 fight each other inside a square ring with certain time rounds. The effort is towards scorin
                  points more than the opponent or knocking him out while abiding by specific rules.
                </p>
                
                <p>The key componentsof boxing include:</p>
                <ol>
                 <li>Weight Classes</li>
                 <p>Weight classes ensure all boxers stay within fair competition. Major classes in this regard include:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Flyweight: Up to 112 lbs (51 kg)</li>
                    <li>Bantamweight: up to 118 lbs (53.5 kg)</li>
                    <li>Featherweight: up to 126 lbs (57 kg)</li>
                    <li>Lightweight: up to 135 lbs (61.2 kg)</li>
                    <li>Welterweight: up to 147 lbs (66.7 kg)</li>
                    <li>Middleweight: up to 160 lbs (72.6 kg)</li>
                    <li>Heavyweight: over 200 lbs (90.7 kg)</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                
                  <li>Scoring System</li>
                    <p>
                    Matches are scored by judges, where points are given for clean punches landed,
                    effective aggression, defense, and overall ring generalship. One regular scoring
                    system is what's known as the "10-point must" system in which the winner of a round
                    takes 10 points, and the loser takes fewer points according to performance.
                    </p>
                
                  <li>Rounds</li>
                    <p>
                    Professional bouts involve 10 to 12 rounds, while the amateur may involve fewer, 
                    often three rounds. Each round lasts three minutes with one-minute inter-rounds.
                    </p>
                
                 <li>Protective Gear</li>
                    <p>
                    The gloves, protection for the mouthguard, and at times headgear are allowed to be
                    worn by the boxers with the intention of reducing the risks associated with potential injury.
                    </p>
                </ol>
       
                <h2>Rules and Regulations of Boxing</h2>
                    <p>
                    While boxing is a sport meant to be governed by strict rules and regulations, some of the
                    specifics do vary between different organizations or jurisdictions. The following are some
                    of the general rules common to most professional and amateur fights.
                    </p>
                    
                
                <p>Some of the basic rules in Boxing include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start of Match</li>
                            <p>
                            The referee gives a signal to begin the match. With that, the two fighters begin.
                            Boxers are to remain in corners until the ringing of the bell.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Legal Punches</li>
                            <p>
                            The only legal punches are thrown with the knuckles of the glove. Each and every
                            strike to the back of the head, below the belt, and a variety of grapples or holds are not allowed.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Knockouts and Technical Knockouts</li>
                            <p>
                            A knockout (KO) occurs when a boxer is knocked down and is unable to get up before a count of ten by the referee.
                            A Techncal Knockout (TKO)is declared when, due to an injury or during a fight, one boxer is unable to 
                            continue, or is overcome by an opponent.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Fouls</li>
                            <p>The boxer is penalized for the following fouls:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hitting after the bell</li>
                                    <li>Holding or clinching</li>
                                    <li>Found with illegal equipment or drugs</li>
                                    <li>Below-the-belt punching</li>
                                </ul>
                
                        <li>Referee's Authority</li>
                            <p>
                            The referee is entitled to stop the fight on grounds of safety or for the
                            assessment of penalties in case of fouls by one of the fighters. Decisions made are final.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>Judging</li>
                            <p>
                            The judges score each round individually, and when the match goes to a distance,
                            the score total is added up. A unanimous decision occurs when all three judges give
                            a win to one fighter, while the victory by split decision comes when two judges go
                            for one fighter and one judge goes for the other.
                            </p>                    
                
                        <li>Disqualification</li>
                            <p>
                            A fighter can be disqualified either due to repeated fouling or for unsportsmanlike conduct.
                            The call is left to the discretion of the referee.
                            </p>
                
                        <li>After the Bout</li>
                            <p>
                            The referee declares the winner at the end of the match. Medical checks are given to boxers
                            after the bout in order to make sure that they are fit and healthy after the bout.
                            </p>
                    </ol>
              <h2>Governing Bodies</h2>
                    <p>                
                    There are a number of different organizations which govern boxing around the world. Each of them 
                    provides sanctioning of its own champion title bouts and/or sets its own rules and regulations to guide 
                    those bouts. Key governing bodies include:
